Hello! My name is Jonathan and I am currently attending the University of Southern California studying computer science & business administration! 
I am interested about integrating business with technology as well as the role artificial intellignece plays in our society today. 
I am currently working on sharpening my skills in computer science as well discovering where I want to specialize in. 
My favorite hobby is playing basketball with friends and watching movies with family!
